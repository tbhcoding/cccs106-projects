**Student Name:** Blessie Faith S. Bongalos
**Student ID:** 231003080
**Section:** BSCS 3-A
**Date:** 08/27/2025

## Environment Setup

### Python Installation
- **Python Version:** 3.12.7
- **Installation Issues:** No installation issues encountered :> 
- **Virtual Environment Created:** ✅ cccs106_env_bongalos

### VS Code Configuration
- **VS Code Version:** 1.103.1
- **Python Extension:** ✅ Installed and configured
- **Interpreter:** ✅ Set to cccs106_env_bongalos/Scripts/python.exe

### Package Installation
- **Flet Version:** 0.28.3

## Programs Created

### 1. hello_world.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Features:** Student info display, age calculation, system info
- **Notes:** Straightforward implementation with clean output formatting

### 2. not-so-basic_calculator.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Features:** Basic arithmetic, advanced operations (power/modulo), comprehensive error handling, statistical analysis, input validation loops, formatted output display
- **Notes:** Python made math fun again! The error handling felt like having a patient tutor who never gets frustrated when you type "banana" instead of a number.

## Challenges and Solutions

The development process proceeded smoothly without significant obstacles. Python's clear syntax and comprehensive documentation made implementation straightforward.

## Learning Outcomes

Through my experiences with Python and programming, I learned a lot about some of the technical and cognitive aspects of software development. My interest in programming stemmed from Python's accessible syntax and easily readable program structure. I was able to direct my time towards the logical steps needed for solving a problem as opposed to dealing with idiosyncratic structures and mechanical constructs of a language. Transitioning from basic text editors to integrated development environments like VS Code and Jupyter notebooks undoubtedly increased my productivity and insights I could draw from my programming, which provided almost instantaneous feedback about changes I make while allowing me to edit, debug, and manage work as projects. Ultimately, programming impacted my more analytical thinking processes. Now, when confronted with a complex problem, I can segment the problem into manageable parts and apply a logical, iterative testing process with debugging of course! It is in fact true that many areas of programming languages and development environments will change, but the logical reasoning, organized problem breakdown, and systematic debugging processes I learned as a result of programming, especially through Python programming, could be applied as transferable skills to other parts of my academic and future professional work.
